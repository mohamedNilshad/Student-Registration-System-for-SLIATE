# Student-Registration-System-for-SLIATE
This GitHub repository houses a C++ program designed to simplify the course registration process for students at SLIATE (Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education). 
By utilizing the power of the command line, this user-friendly interface allows students to register for courses conveniently and efficiently.

This is done for collage 1st year assignment by me in 2021.
